# TermPlanner

### Description
TermPlanner was developed as a final project for Western Governor University's C971 Mobile App Development course using Xamarin and C#.

For this task, you will develop a multiple-screen mobile application for WGU students to track their academic terms, courses associated with each term, and assessments associated with each course. The application will allow students to enter, edit, and delete term, course, and assessment data. It should provide summary and detailed views of courses for each term, provide notifications for upcoming performance and objective assessments, and notify students of deadlines and tracking milestones even after the application is closed. You will create a wireframe as a visual guide, representing the skeletal framework of the application. Your application will use an SQLite database.
